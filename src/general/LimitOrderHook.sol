/**
 * @dev Limit Order Mechanism hook.
 *
 * Allows users to place limit orders at specific ticks outside of the current price range,
 * which will be filled if the pool's price crosses the order's tick.
 *
 * Note that given the way UniswapV4 pools works, when liquidity is added out of the current range,
 * a single currency will be provided, instead of both currencies as in in-range liquidity additions.
 *
 * Orders can be cancelled at any time until they are filled and their liquidity is removed from the pool.
 * Once completely filled, the resulting liquidity can be withdrawn from the pool.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Fees accrued by an order are credited per unit of liquidity, so each owner is entitled to the
 * fees earned while its liquidity was in the order and to none of those earned before it. Amounts are truncated
 * in the order's favour, so a negligible residual can remain in the hook.
 *
 * WARNING: This is experimental software and is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do
 * not give any warranties and will not be liable for any losses incurred through any use of this code
 * base.
